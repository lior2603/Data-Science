Project on wines
This project On the subject of wines. 
My research question is - can the quality of wine taste be predicted according to the wine data?
The process included -
receiving data using an API, handling data (checking for missing data and handling abnormal data). Graphical presentation of data, comparisons between data and at the end of a prediction attempt with the help of some common algorithms.
In this process a lot of effort and a lot of investment has been put into it.
Thank you,
Lior
